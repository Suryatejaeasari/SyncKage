# SyncKage – Real-Time Google Drive Sync for Android  
 
Google Drive for Desktop enables seamless folder synchronization, but its Android counterpart lacks automatic sync.  
**SyncKage** bridges this gap by enabling **real-time, two-way synchronization** between local storage and Google Drive, just like Google Drive for Desktop.  

## Features  
- **Real-Time File Monitoring** – Instantly detects changes using FileObserver  
- **Multi-Folder Sync Support** – Synchronizes multiple folders seamlessly  
- **Two Sync Modes:** Hidden (ADB-controlled) & UI Mode  
- **Optimized Uploads & Downloads** – Prevents redundant transfers  
- **Stealth Mode** – No UI, No App Icon, Runs in Background  
- **Auto-Start on Boot** – Ensures continuous operation  
- **Secure Authentication** – Uses Google Drive API with a service account  
- **Parallel Processing** – Uses Coroutines for faster synchronization  

## Tech Stack  
- **Kotlin** – Core language  
- **Android Foreground Service** – Background execution  
- **FileObserver API** – Monitors file changes  
- **Google Drive API** – Cloud synchronization  
- **Coroutines** – Handles parallel tasks  

## Setup & Usage  
 > **Note:** SyncKage requires a Google Drive service account for authentication.  
 > Due to security reasons, the service account JSON key is not included in this repository.  

#### **Usage Modes**  
1. **Hidden Mode (Stealth)** – Runs as a background service, controllable via ADB.  
2. **UI Mode** – Provides Start/Stop buttons and real-time logs.

## Limitations  
- **Service Account Requirement** – Users must create and configure their own Google Drive service account.  
- **No Installation Guide** – Due to authentication constraints, installation steps are skipped.  
- **Requires ADB for Hidden Mode** – Stealth mode is designed for power users with ADB knowledge.  

## Future Scope  
- Custom sync intervals for better power efficiency  
- Encryption before upload for enhanced security
